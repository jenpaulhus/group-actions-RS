dim|smallint|dimension of the family of curves, this is a non-negative integer
group_order|integer|order of the group
r|smallint|number of branch points of the cover, non-negative integer
signature|~~text~~ integer[]|  a list of non-negative integers [g0,m1,...,mr] where g0 is the quotient genus, and the mi represent the orders of the generators of the monodromy group 
genus|smallint|genus of the family of curves, this is a positive integer > 1
con|~~text~~ text[]|  labels connected to abstract db
braid|integer[]|ordered pair of positive integers designating the "cc" entry for the generating vector which is the representative for the orbit under braid action which the given generating vector falls into
topological|integer[]|number of distinct generating vectors, up to topological equivalence, for this genus and group (if g0_is_gt0 is false)
connected_genvec|text[]|generating vectors listed as products of generators from abstract groups db
trans_group | text | if nonabelian or abelian and of order <=47, smallest transitive group nTt from Galois group db, NULL if abelian and order >48 or nonabelian and not in db
min_deg | ~~smallint~~ integer | if nonabelian and in Galois group db, the n from trans_group else NULL,  if abelian the order of the group, i.e. smallest transitive degree
