If the entry represents the full automorphism group, then
it has the following format:

F
group
signature
conjugacy class indices
conjugacy class labels
cc (last two numbers in total_label)
braid       (or [ 0, 0 ] if g0>0)
topological (or [ 0, 0 ] if g0>0)
jacobian decomposition
ranks (genvec as a list of integers)
genvec
connected genvec (if group is nonsolvable, then this line is "Nonsolvable")
transitive group label (or "N/A" if group is not in trans db or 
                                 if it is abelian and the order is too large)
minimum transitive degree
HY or HN (if HN, then the next three lines are "N/A")
hyperelliptic involution
hyperelliptic involution rank (an integer)
equations
CY or CN (if CY, then the next two lines are "N/A")
trigonal automorphism
trigonal automorphism rank (an integer)
